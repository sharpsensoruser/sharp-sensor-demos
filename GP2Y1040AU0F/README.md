Sharp GP2Y1040AU0F VCSEL Laser Dust Sensor Application Guide

## Overview
**GP2Y1040AU0F** is the brand new flagship model in Sharp's lineup of air quality sensors. 
Designed for use in commercial air purifiers, GP2Y1040AU0F is a VCSEL laser-based particle counting sensor with built-in fan.
The sensor outputs particle counts in the form of number concentrations for different ranges of particle sizes as well as
the corresponding dust density values such as PM2.5 and PM10.
